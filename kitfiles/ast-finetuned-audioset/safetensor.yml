   Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model fine-tuned on AudioSet.
   The Audio Spectrogram Transformer is equivalent to ViT, but 
   applied on audio. Audio is first turned into an image (as a 
   spectrogram), after which a Vision Transformer is applied. 
   The model gets state-of-the-art results on several audio 
   classification benchmarks.
